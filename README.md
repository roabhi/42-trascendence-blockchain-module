# 42-trascendence-blockchain-module

This is one of the major modules for the project ft_trascendence at 42 school in Barcelona.

With this module we are asked to store the score of a tournament in the Blockchain.

This Major module focuses on implementing a feature within the Pong website to store tournament scores securely on a blockchain. It is essential to clarify that for development and testing purposes, we will utilize a testing blockchain environment. The chosen blockchain for this implementation is Ethereum , and Solidity will be the programming language used for smart contract development.

- Blockchain Integration: The primary goal of this module is to seamlessly integrate blockchain technology, specifically Ethereum , into the Pong website. This integration ensures the secure and immutable storage of tournament scores, providing players with a transparent and tamper-proof record of their gaming achievements.
- Solidity Smart Contracts: To interact with the blockchain, we will develop Solidity smart contracts. These contracts will be responsible for recording, managing, and retrieving tournament scores.
- Testing Blockchain: As mentioned earlier, a testing blockchain will be employed for development and testing purposes. This ensures that all blockchainrelated functionalities are thoroughly validated without any risks associated with a live blockchain.
- Interoperability: This module may have dependencies on other modules, particularly the Backend Framework module. Integrating blockchain functionality might necessitate adjustments in the backend to accommodate interactions with the blockchain.

By implementing this module, we aim to enhance the Pong website by introducing a blockchain-based score storage system. Users will benefit from the added layer of security and transparency, ensuring the integrity of their gaming scores. The module emphasizes the use of a testing blockchain environment to minimize risks associated with blockchain development.
